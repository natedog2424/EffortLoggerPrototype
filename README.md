## Effort Logger

The Effort Logger application provides a complete software package for logging effort in software projects to assist in time managment and effort estimation.

The project was created by a group of 5 students for Professor Robert Lynn Carter's CSE360 Intro to Software Engineering course.

The Application is written in Java and utilizes the JavaFX library for the GUI. Data storage is handled via a local SQLite database.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
